<h1>Overview </h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
The project consists of two main applications, an Apple Watch app and a website. The combination of these two applications provide a user with a more informational and interactive interface to display the user’s heart rate data. From the user’s Apple Watch the application will send the heart rate information collected by it and send the data to the website. The website will be able to display the collected information such as the current heart rate and view past heart rate data entries. The website will also offer inputs to select certain period of time to display that on a table and chart for visual aid. Overall this project is to be able to get more use of the information collected on a person smart watch.

<h3>Why These?</h3>

  <b>React JS</b>
  <blockquote>
    React is a light weight framework in JavaScript that is great for dynamic web pages. For the dashboard setup that iHeartRate includes the table, graph, average heart rate, and the last recorded. All of these components must be updated with the click of a button. With React this is done easily with its capabilities such as state and props.
  </blockquote>
  <b>Express JS</b>
  <blockquote>
    Just like React, Express JS is a very light weight application that is easily configured in order to create a REST API. Express also has many libraries that help with the implentation of cross platform request and other Dev Op principles. This means that it is very easy to implement logging and cross origin reasource sharing through middleware.
